## Research Question:
Our research objective for this project is to be able to predict and project future housing prices in California as well as being able to recognize trends that result in being able to see what things determine the value of a certain house. Our dataset gives us information like the longitude and latitude coordinates, population of an area, the area’s average income, etc.

Some of the Hypothesis and research aims we will be looking into:
- The area of the housing affects the pricing and certain regions have increases or decreases in pricing.
- The size of the house with the amount of bedrooms and bathrooms affect the median house value.
- The amount of bedrooms compared to bathrooms will have something to do with the area.
- Ocean proximity increase the prices of housing?
- The more a population resides in a block, the lower the prices will be for the houses around them.
- A higher median income will result in a higher average price for a house in a given area.
- The age of the houses in the area reflects the population in the area and their income.

Dataset we will use:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices/data
The dataset we will use is titled “California Housing Prices” which we found on Kaggle and was uploaded by Cam Nugent. He claims that this dataset was used in the second chapter of Aurelien Geron’s book about machine learning. The data was collected from the 1990 census but was updated 6 years ago. The dataset has 10 columns with 20,600 individual rows for a nice medium amount of data to work with. 
The columns this dataset have are
- Longitude coordinates
- Latitude coordinates
- Median housing age
- Total rooms
- Total bedrooms
- Population of the area
- Amount in a household 
- Median household income
- Median house value
- Proximity to the ocean
